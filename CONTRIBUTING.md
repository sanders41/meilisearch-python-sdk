# Contributing

## Where to start

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are
welcome.

The best place to start is to check the
[issues](https://github.com/sanders41/meilisearch-python-sdk/issues) for something that interests you.

## Bug Reports

Please include:

1. A short, self-contained Python snippet reproducing the problem. You can format the code by using
   [GitHub markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github).
   For example:

```py
from meilisearch_python_sdk import Client

async with Client(BASE_URL, MASTER_KEY) as client:
    client.index("movies")
    ...
```

2. Explain what is currently happening and what you expect instead.

## Working on the code

### Fork the project

In order to work on the project you will need your own fork. To do this click the "Fork" button on
this project.

Once the project is forked clone it to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-user-name/meilisearch-python-sdk.git
cd meilisearch-python-sdk
git remote add upstream https://github.com/sanders41/meilisearch-python-sdk.git
```

This creates the directory meilisearch-python-sdk and connects your repository to the upstream
(main project) repository.

### Working with the code

Note: This project uses uv to manage dependencies. If you do not already have uv installed you will
need to install it with the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

First the requirements need to be installed.

```sh
uv sync --locked --all-extras
```

### Creating a branch

You want your main branch to reflect only production-ready code, so create a feature branch for
making your changes. For example:

```sh
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

This changes your working directory to the my-new-feature branch. Keep any changes in this branch
specific to one bug or feature so the purpose is clear. You can have many my-new-features and switch
in between them using the git checkout command.

When creating this branch, make sure your main branch is up to date with the latest upstream
main version. To update your local main branch, you can do:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull upstream main --ff-only
```

### Code Standards and tests (ruff, mypy, pytest, and pre-commit)

meilisearch-python-sdk uses [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), and
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to ensure consistent code formatting.

You can run linting on your code at any time with:

```sh
# Run ruff formatting
uv run ruff format meilisearch_python_sdk tests

# Run ruff linting
uv run ruff check .

# Run mypy
uv run mypy meilisearch_python_sdk
```

It is also suggested that you setup [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) in order to run linting
when you commit changes to you branch. To setup pre-commit for this project run:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

After this pre-commit will automatically run any time you check in code to your branches. You can
also run pre-commit at any time with:

```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Type Hints

At a minimum all variables/arguments that receive data should contain type hints, and all
functions/methods should specify the return type.

Accepted examples:

```py
def my_function(argument: str) -> None:
    ...


def another_function(num: int) -> int:
    return num + 1
```

Rejected examples:

```py
def my_function(argument):
    ...


def another_function(num):
    return num + 1
```

Type hints on files in the tests directory are optional.

### Testing

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing. Please ensure that any
additions/changes you make to the code have tests to go along with them. Code coverage should not
drop blow it's current level with any pull requests you make, if it does the pull request will not
be accepted. You can view the current coverage level in the codecov badge on the
[main github page](https://github.com/sanders41/meilisearch-python-sdk). You can run tests and see the
code coverage.

There are multiple way Meilisearch can be setup for testing. The examples below use docker, however
installing and starting Meilisearch with any [installation](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/getting_started/quick_start.html#setup-and-installation)
will work.

Before running the tests start a Docker container running Meilisearch, or start with the appropriate
mething for how you installed Meilisearch if not using docker.

```sh
docker pull getmeili/meilisearch:latest
docker run -p 7700:7700 getmeili/meilisearch:latest meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics
```

Now with the container running, run the test suite

```sh
uv run pytest
```

In additon to mainting the coverage percentage please ensure that all
tests are passing before submitting a pull request.

#### just

If you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed it can be used for testing and linting.

To run linting:

```sh
just lint
```

Using just to run the tests will start Meilisearch in a Docker container, run the tests, then stop
the container.

```sh
just test
```

To see a full list of `just` commands run `just --list`

## Docs

Documentation is automatically generated based on the doc strings from the functions/methods. If
functions/methods are added/removed make sure to update the
[api documentation page](https://github.com/sanders41/meilisearch-python-sdk/docs/api.md) accordingly.

You can view any changes to the docs locally by running:

```sh
mkdocs serve
```

Building the docs can be testing by running:

```sh
mkdocs build --strict
```

## Committing your code

Once you have made changes to the code on your branch you can see which files have changed by running:

```sh
git status
```

If new files were created that and are not tracked by git they can be added by running:

```sh
git add .
```

Now you can commit your changes in your local repository:

```sh
git commit -am 'Some short helpful message to describe your changes'
```

If you setup pre-commit and any of the tests fail the commit will be cancelled and you will need to
fix any errors. Once the errors are fixed you can run the same git commit command again.

## Push your changes

Once your changes are ready and all linting/tests are passing you can push your changes to your
forked repository:

```sh
git push origin my-new-feature
```

origin is the default name of your remote repository on GitHub. You can see all of your remote
repositories by running:

```sh
git remote -v
```

## Making a Pull Request

After pushing your code to origin it is now on GitHub but not yet part of the
meilisearch-python-sdk project. When you’re ready to ask for a code review, file a pull request.
Before you do, once again make sure that you have followed all the guidelines outlined in this
document regarding code style, tests, and documentation.

### Make the pull request

If everything looks good, you are ready to make a pull request. This is how you let the maintainers
of the meilisearch-python-sdk project know you have code ready to be reviewed. To submit the pull
request:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on the Pull Request button for your feature branch
3. You can then click on Commits and Files Changed to make sure everything looks okay one last time
4. Write a description of your changes in the Conversation tab
5. Click Send Pull Request

This request then goes to the repository maintainers, and they will review the code.

### Updating your pull request

Changes to your code may be needed based on the review of your pull request. If this is the case you
can make them in your branch, add a new commit to that branch, push it to GitHub, and the pull
request will be automatically updated. Pushing them to GitHub again is done by:

```sh
git push origin my-new-feature
```

This will automatically update your pull request with the latest code and restart the Continuous
Integration tests.

Another reason you might need to update your pull request is to solve conflicts with changes that
have been merged into the main branch since you opened your pull request.

To do this, you need to rebase your branch:

```sh
git checkout my-new-feature
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

There may be some merge conficts that need to be resolved. After the feature branch has been update
locally, you can now update your pull request by pushing to the branch on GitHub:

```sh
git push origin my-new-feature
```

If you rebased and get an error when pushing your changes you can resolve it with:

```sh
git push origin my-new-feature --force
```

## Delete your merged branch (optional)

Once your feature branch is accepted into upstream, you’ll probably want to get rid of the branch.
First, merge upstream main into your main branch so git knows it is safe to delete your branch:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
```

Then you can do:

```sh
git branch -d my-new-feature
```

Make sure you use a lower-case -d, or else git won’t warn you if your feature branch has not
actually been merged.

The branch will still exist on GitHub, so to delete it there do:

```sh
git push origin --delete my-new-feature
```
